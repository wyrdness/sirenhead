      "summary": "A 40-foot tall humanoid creature with sirens for a head, created by horror artist Trevor Henderson in 2018. The character mimics voices and emergency broadcasts to lure victims. Despite being documented as fictional art, Sirenhead has spawned belief claims, video games, and widespread internet folklore.",
      "full": "Sirenhead is a horror character created by Canadian artist Trevor Henderson in 2018 through digital artwork posted to social media. The creature is depicted as an approximately 40-foot tall, skeletal humanoid with mummified skin and two sirens or megaphones where a head should be. According to Henderson's fiction, Sirenhead can mimic human voices, animal sounds, and emergency broadcasts with perfect accuracy to lure victims. It possesses immense strength, moves with disturbing silence despite its size, and inhabits rural areas and forests. The character went viral in 2018-2019, inspiring video games, YouTube videos, and extensive fan content. Despite Henderson clearly stating Sirenhead is his fictional creation, some claim to have witnessed it, and it's often confused with SCP Foundation content (it is NOT an SCP). Sirenhead represents modern cryptid creation via internet art, tapping into anxieties about emergency broadcast systems, rural isolation, and the uncanny valley. The phenomenon demonstrates how internet-native characters can blur the line between acknowledged fiction and pseudo-cryptid belief."
