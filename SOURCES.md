## Final Note

Sirenhead represents how modern internet culture can create "instant cryptids" through viral art. Unlike traditional folklore that evolves over generations, we can watch Sirenhead's entire history from 2018 creation to viral phenomenon in real-time.

**Why document as folklore?**
- Demonstrates modern mythology creation
- Shows internet's power to create shared fictional entities
- Valuable for studying belief formation around fiction
- Important cultural artifact of 2018-2020s internet

**Remember**: Fictional creation ≠ not worth studying. Sirenhead is **real** as cultural phenomenon, **fictional** as actual creature.
